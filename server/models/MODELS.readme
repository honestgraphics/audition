For now the audition schema doesn't link to other schemas for Associates or Managers.
I wanted to wait until Passport is finished to implement that change. Many entries
are marked as required: true and other false. I wasn't sure what information the 
modal encapsulated so there may be more entries in the schema than we need. On a
review we can see what needs changing.


index.js contain some changes that exports the users connection line 5-8
